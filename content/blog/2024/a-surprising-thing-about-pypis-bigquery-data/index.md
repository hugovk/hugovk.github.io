You can get download numbers for PyPI packages (or projects) from a
[Google BigQuery dataset](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/analyzing-pypi-package-downloads/).
You need a Google account and credentials, and Google gives 1 TiB of free quota per
month.

Each month, I have automation to fetch the download numbers for the 8,000 most popular
packages over the past 30 days, and make it available as more accessible JSON and CSV
files at [Top PyPI Packages](https://hugovk.dev/top-pypi-packages/). This data is
[widely used](https://hugovk.dev/top-pypi-packages/#users) for
[research in academia and industry](https://github.com/hugovk/top-pypi-packages/issues/23).

However, as more packages and releases are uploaded to PyPI, and there are more and more
downloads logged, the amount of billed data increases too.

![BigQuery TB billed](sego7uxbpslifzd791ee.png)

This chart shows the amount of data billed per month.

At first, I was only collecting downloads data for 4,000 packages, and it was fetched
for two queries: downloads over 365 days and over 30 days. But as time passed, it
started using up too much quota to download data for 365 days.

So I ditched the 365-day data, and increased the 30-day data from 4,000 to 5,000
packages. Later, I checked how much quota was being used and increased from 5,000
packages to 8,000 packages.

But then I exceeded the BigQuery monthly quota of 1 TiB fetching data for July 2024.

To fetch the missing data and investigate what's going in, I started Google Cloud's
90-day, $300 (€277.46) free-trial 💸

Here's what I found!

## Finding: it costs more to get data for downloads from only pip than from all installers

I use the [pypinfo](https://github.com/ofek/pypinfo) client to help query BigQuery. By
default, it only fetches downloads for pip.

### Only pip

This command gets one day's download data for the top 10 packages, _for pip only_:

```console
$ pypinfo --limit 10 --days 1 "" project
Served from cache: False
Data processed: 58.21 GiB
Data billed: 58.21 GiB
Estimated cost: $0.29
```

Results:

| project            |  download count |
| ------------------ | --------------: |
| boto3              |      37,251,744 |
| aiobotocore        |      16,252,824 |
| urllib3            |      16,243,278 |
| botocore           |      15,687,125 |
| requests           |      13,271,314 |
| s3fs               |      12,865,055 |
| s3transfer         |      12,014,278 |
| fsspec             |      11,982,305 |
| charset-normalizer |      11,684,740 |
| certifi            |      11,639,584 |
| **Total**          | **158,892,247** |

### All installers

Adding the `--all` flag gets one day's download data for the top 10 packages, _for all
installers_:

```console
$ pypinfo --all --limit 10 --days 1 "" project
Served from cache: False
Data processed: 46.63 GiB
Data billed: 46.63 GiB
Estimated cost: $0.23
```

| project            |  download count |
| ------------------ | --------------: |
| boto3              |      39,495,624 |
| botocore           |      17,281,187 |
| urllib3            |      17,225,121 |
| aiobotocore        |      16,430,826 |
| requests           |      14,287,965 |
| s3fs               |      12,958,516 |
| charset-normalizer |      12,781,405 |
| certifi            |      12,647,098 |
| setuptools         |      12,608,120 |
| idna               |      12,510,335 |
| **Total**          | **168,226,197** |

So we can see the default pip-only costs an extra 25% data processed and data billed,
and costs an extra 25% in dollars.

Unsurprisingly, the actual download counts are higher for all installers. The ranking
has changed a bit, but I expect we're still getting more-or-less the same packages in
the top thousands of results.

### Queries

It sends a query like this to BigQuery for only pip:

```sql
SELECT
  file.project as project,
  COUNT(*) as download_count,
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads`
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -2 DAY) AND TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -1 DAY)
  AND details.installer.name = "pip"
GROUP BY
  project
ORDER BY
  download_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

And for all installers:

```sql
SELECT
  file.project as project,
  COUNT(*) as download_count,
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads`
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -2 DAY) AND TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -1 DAY)
GROUP BY
  project
ORDER BY
  download_count DESC
LIMIT 10
```

These queries are the same, except the default has an extra
`AND details.installer.name = "pip"` condition. It seems reasonable it would cost more
to do extra filtering work.

### Installers

Let's look at the installers:

```console
$ pypinfo --all --limit 100 --days 1 "" installer
Served from cache: False
Data processed: 29.49 GiB
Data billed: 29.49 GiB
Estimated cost: $0.15
```

| installer name |    download count |
| -------------- | ----------------: |
| pip            |     1,121,198,711 |
| uv             |       117,194,833 |
| requests       |        29,828,272 |
| poetry         |        23,009,454 |
| None           |         8,916,745 |
| bandersnatch   |         6,171,555 |
| setuptools     |         1,362,797 |
| Bazel          |         1,280,271 |
| Browser        |         1,096,328 |
| Nexus          |           593,230 |
| Homebrew       |           510,247 |
| Artifactory    |            69,063 |
| pdm            |            62,904 |
| OS             |            13,108 |
| devpi          |             9,530 |
| conda          |             2,272 |
| pex            |               194 |
| **Total**      | **1,311,319,514** |

pip still by far the most popular, and unsurprising uv is up there too, with about 10%
of pip's downloads.

The others are about 25% or less of uv. A lot of them are mirroring services that we
wanted to exclude before.

I think given uv's importance, and my expectation that it will continue to take a bigger
share of the pie, plus especially the extra cost for filtering by just pip, means that
we should switch to fetching data for all downloaders. Plus the others don't account for
that much of the pie.

## Finding: the number of packages doesn't affect the cost

This was the biggest surprise. Earlier I'd been increasing or decreasing the number to
try and remain under quota. But it turns out it makes no difference how many packages
you query!

I fetched data for just one day and all installers for different package limits: 1000,
2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000. Sample query:

```sql
SELECT
  file.project as project,
  COUNT(*) as download_count,
FROM `bigquery-public-data.pypi.file_downloads`
WHERE timestamp BETWEEN TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -2 DAY) AND TIMESTAMP_ADD(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL -1 DAY)
GROUP BY
  project
ORDER BY
  download_count DESC
LIMIT 8000
```

![Cost and bytes for 1 day with different package limits are the same](03tmt980ypp67qryra26.png)

**Result:** Interestingly, the cost is the same for all limits (1000-8000): $0.31.

Repeating with one day but filtering for pip only:

![Cost and bytes for 1 day still the same for pip](al96xqbescc64lavi4y7.png)

**Result:** Cost increased to $0.39 but again the same for all limits.

Let's repeat with all installers, but for 30 days, and this time query in decreasing
limits, in case we were only paying for incremental changes: 8000, 7000, 6000, 5000,
4000, 3000, 2000, 1000:

![Cost and bytes for 30 day still the same no matter how many packages](jhci1bcxrgncb34wwldm.png)

**Result:** Again, the cost is the same regardless of package limit: $4.89 per query.

Well then, let's repeat with the limit increasing by powers of ten, up to 1,000,000!
This last one fetches data for all 531,022 packages on PyPI:

| limit   | projects count | estimated cost | bytes billed   | bytes processed |
| ------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| 1       | 1              | 0.20           | 43,447,746,560 | 43,447,720,943  |
| 10      | 10             | 0.20           | 43,447,746,560 | 43,447,720,943  |
| 100     | 100            | 0.20           | 43,447,746,560 | 43,447,720,943  |
| 1000    | 1,000          | 0.20           | 43,447,746,560 | 43,447,720,943  |
| 8000    | 8,000          | 0.20           | 43,447,746,560 | 43,447,720,943  |
| 10000   | 10,000         | 0.20           | 43,447,746,560 | 43,447,720,943  |
| 100000  | 100,000        | 0.20           | 43,447,746,560 | 43,447,720,943  |
| 1000000 | 531,022        | 0.20           | 43,447,746,560 | 43,447,720,943  |

![Still same flat cost and bytes for 1 or 10 or 1,000 or 1,000,000 packages](3pitkptggoit9xdypjp2.png)

**Result:** Again, same cost, whether for 1 package or 531,022 packages!

## Finding: the number of days affects the cost

No surprise. I'd earlier noticed 365 days too took much quota, and I could continue with
30 days.

Here's the estimated cost and bytes billed (for one package, all installers) between one
and 30 days (`f"pypinfo --all --json --indent 0 --days {days} --limit 1 '' project"`),
showing a roughly linear increase:

![Cost and bytes increase as the number of days increase](aa4kq8d5neuxj9mf1g2v.png)

## Conclusion

- It doesn't matter how many packages I fetch data for, I might as well fetch all and
  make it available to everyone, depending on the size of the data file. It will make
  sense to still offer a smaller file with 8,000 or so packages: often you just need a
  large-ish yet manageable number.

- It costs more to filter for only downloads from pip, so I've switched to fetching data
  for all installers.

- The number of days affects the cost, so I will need to decrease this in the future to
  stay within quota. For example, at some point I may need to switch from 30 to 25 days,
  and later from 25 to 20 days.

[hugovk/top-pypi-packages#36](https://github.com/hugovk/top-pypi-packages/issues/36).

And let me know if you know any tricks to reduce costs!
