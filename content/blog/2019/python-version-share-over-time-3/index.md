## January 2016 — December 2018

To celebrate the release of
[Python 3.7.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-372/) on
[Christmas Eve 2018](https://peps.python.org/pep-0537/), and with
u[nder a year left for Python 2](https://hugovk.dev/python2-progress-bar/), here's some
statistics showing how much different Python versions have been used over the past three
years.

Here's the pip installs for all packages from the
[Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/), between January 2016 and December
2018:

For the [Pillow](https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow) imaging library:

## How

Statistics were collected using
[pypi-trends.py](https://github.com/hugovk/pypi-tools/blob/master/pypi-trends.py) a
wrapper around [pypinfo](https://github.com/ofek/pypinfo) to fetch all monthly downloads
from the PyPI database on Google BigQuery and save them as JSON files. Data was
downloaded over several days as getting all months uses up a lot of free BigQuery quota.
Then [jsons2csv.py](https://github.com/hugovk/pypi-tools/blob/master/jsons2csv.py) plots
a chart using [matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). Raw JSON data is
in the [repo](https://github.com/hugovk/pypi-tools/tree/master/data).
